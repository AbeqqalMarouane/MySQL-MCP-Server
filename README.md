  This repository contains a general-purpose, secure, and efficient **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** server for MySQL databases. It acts as a secure bridge, allowing AI agents and applications (MCP Clients) to interact with any MySQL database without needing direct credentials.

  This server is designed to be a standalone, reusable component. It was originally developed for the [EventScribe AI](https://github.com/AbeqqalMarouane/PromptEnhancing_UsingMCP) project but can be used by any MCP-compatible client.

  ## ‚ú® Key Features

  - **High Performance**: Uses a MySQL connection pool for efficient, high-concurrency database interactions suitable for production environments.
  - **Database Agnostic**: While using the `mysql2` driver, the server's logic and configuration via environment variables allow it to connect to any MySQL-compatible database (local, cloud-based, or containerized).
  - **Graceful Shutdown**: Includes logic to cleanly close database connections when the server process is terminated.

  ## üèóÔ∏è Architecture: The Server's Role

  This MCP server is the "Data Layer" in a modern agentic architecture. The client (e.g., a Next.js application) orchestrates the workflow, while this server is the only component with direct access to the database.

    end

  ## üöÄ Getting Started

  ### Prerequisites
  - Node.js 18+
  - A running MySQL 8.0+ database instance.

  ### Installation & Setup

  1. Clone the repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/AbeqqalMarouane/MySQL-MCP-Server.git
  cd MySQL-MCP-Server
  ```

  2. Install dependencies:
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

  3. Set up environment variables:
     - Create a `.env` file in the root of the project:
  
     - Then, edit the `.env` file with your database credentials:
  ```env
  # In MySQL-MCP-Server/.env
  DB_HOST=localhost
  DB_USER=root
  DB_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password
  DB_NAME=your_database_name
  DB_PORT=3306
  ```

  4. Build the TypeScript code:
  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```
  This compiles the `src/index.ts` file into a runnable JavaScript file in the `build/` directory.

  ## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

  This server is designed to be launched and controlled by an MCP client.

  ### 1. Testing with MCP Inspector
  The easiest way to test the server is with the official MCP Inspector tool. From the project's root directory, run:
  ```bash
  npx -- @modelcontextprotocol/inspector npm start
  ```
  This will launch the Inspector UI in your browser, where you can directly interact with the server's resources and tools.

  ### 2. Integrating with a Programmatic Client
  To use this server in your own application (like a Next.js API route), configure your client's `StdioClientTransport` to run the server's `npm start` command.

  Example Client Configuration:
  ```javascript
  // In your client application code
  const transport = new StdioClientTransport({
    command: "npm",
    args: ["start"],
    cwd: "/path/to/your/MySQL-MCP-Server" // Absolute path to this project
  });
  ```

  ## üìñ Exposed MCP Capabilities

  This server exposes two primary capabilities to any connected client.

  ### Resource: schema
  - **URI**: `mysql://schemas`
  - **Description**: Returns the full `CREATE TABLE` SQL statements for all tables in the connected database. This allows an AI agent to learn the complete structure of the database.
  - **Usage (in a client)**: `mcpClient.readResource({ uri: "mysql://schemas" })`

  ### Tool: read_only_query
  - **Name**: `read_only_query`
  - **Description**: Executes a SQL query against the database.
  - **Input Schema**: `{ sql: string }`
  - **Security**: The tool contains a vital security check. It will only execute queries that begin with `SELECT`. Any other command (`UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `INSERT`, `DROP`, etc.) will be rejected with an error.
  - **Usage (in a client)**: `mcpClient.callTool({ name: "read_only_query", arguments: { sql: "SELECT * FROM events LIMIT 10" } })`
